          <b>USM & ARCHITECTURE</b>
          <h1>In Architecture</h1>
          <p>
            Located in Munsingen, Switzerland, USM was founded in 1885 as a family-owned metals factory. It was Paul Scharer junior, grandson of the founder and father of the current leader, who, with the intention of strengthening industrialisation, propelled USM into modernity in the early 60s.
            Passionate about design and architecture, and a great admirer of Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier, in 1961 he commissioned the Swiss architect Fritz Haller to design a new flexible building that could accommodate the administration office, and the production lines. <br><br>Fritz Haller (1924-2012) was one of the most influential Swiss architects of the second half of the 20th century. He was a member of the Solothurn School group of architects and was an architectural theorist as well as a designer of buildings.
